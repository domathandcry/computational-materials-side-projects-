# computational-materials-side-projects-

Graduated with a bachelor in biomedical engineering and currently undergoing training as a material scientist/engineer, but my curiosity and love towards computing continues! Occsasionally I look at dataset and tinker with them and see what I can harvest from them. Projects included:

1.) diffusion in alloy.ipynb
  - Predicting diffusion coefficient for alloys with different host metals
